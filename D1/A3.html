    <h3>Data types in Java Script</h3>
<body>
    <p>The Primitive Data types in JavaScript include Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Symbol.</p>
    <p>Numbers:A number data type can be an integer, a floating point value, an exponential value, a ‘NaN’ or a ‘Infinity’.</p>
    <p>Strings:The string data type in JavaScript can be any group of characters enclosed by a single or double-quotes.</p>
    <p>Boolean:The boolean data type has only two values, true and false. It is mostly used to check a logical condition. Thus Booleans are logical data types which can be used for comparison of two variables or to check a condition.</p>
    <p>Undefined:Undefined data type means a variable that is not defined. The variable is declared but doesn’t contain any value.</p>
    <p>Null:The null in JavaScript is a data type that is represented by only one value, the ‘null’ itself. A null value means no value and it is not zero.</p>
    <p>Symbol:The ‘symbol’ data type is new in es6. It is one of the new features of es6. The symbol data type defines a property of an object which is private to the object. It refers to the ‘key’ of the key-value pair of an object.</p>
    <p>The Non-Primitive data type has only one member i.e. the Object.</p>
    <p>Objects written as name value pairs are similar to:
        1)Arrays
        2)Dictionaries
        3)Functions</p>
